  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  <blockquote>
    At Be The Light Ministries, our mission is to be the light of Christ in a
    world that desperately needs His love. Through daily devotionals, impactful
    sermons, and a commitment to serving others, we strive to inspire, equip,
    and uplift believers in their faith journey. Guided by Scripture and the
    Holy Spirit, we seek to share the Gospel, encourage spiritual growth, and
    meet the needs of those around us with compassion and humility. Our purpose
    is to reflect Godâ€™s love in both word and action, so that all may come to
    know the hope, grace, and salvation found in Jesus Christ.
